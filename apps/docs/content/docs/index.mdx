description: Antd Design Forge is an opinionated collection of components and hooks for Ant Design that I find myself recreating across projects. This is my take on better TypeScript support, schema validation, and common patterns for building data-driven applications.

  antd-typed is still in early development and does not have a stable release
  yet. The API may change.

## Why?

In my experience, Ant Design, although being a generally well made library, has some shortcomings with typings and you typically have to reach for the same boilerplate across applications to build common SaaS features.

[refine.dev](https://refine.dev/) solves this in their own ways but locks you into their data flow and framework.

**antd-typed** takes a different approach: no framework or library lock-ins. You can enhance your experience using industry standard libraries like TanStack Query and your choice of schema validation, but everything is built with just Ant Design and React as a base.

## Standard Schema Support

antd-typed supports [Standard Schema](https://github.com/standard-schema/standard-schema) specification, which means you can use any compatible validation library:

- **[Zod](https://zod.dev)** - TypeScript-first schema validation
- **[Valibot](https://valibot.dev)** - Lightweight schema library
- **[ArkType](https://arktype.io)** - TypeScript's 1:1 validator

Simply pass your schema to the `validator` option and antd-typed handles the rest: validation on submit, error mapping to fields, and automatic required field detection.
