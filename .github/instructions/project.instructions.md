# Project Instructions

This file contains instructions that apply to the entire project.

## Tools

- Prettier for formatting
- ESLint for linting (JS/TS)
- TypeScript for type checks
- Vitest for tests
- bun for package management and scripts

## Testing

- Scope tests to the package you touch.
- Example: `cd packages/antd-forge && bun run test --run` (run mode disables watch so input is readable).
